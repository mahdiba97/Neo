Android Notes
=================

A noting app illustrating Android development with Android Jetpack, Dagger Hilt and Rxjava


Introduction
------------

Android [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) is a set of components, tools and guidance to make great Android apps. They bring
together the existing Support Library and Architecture Components. Also [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application. In order to have functional reactive programming in android development, [Rxkotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin) helps develop app much easier.


Android Notes demonstrates utilizing these components to create a simple noting app.
